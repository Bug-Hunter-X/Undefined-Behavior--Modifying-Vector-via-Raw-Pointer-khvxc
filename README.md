This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in Rust involving undefined behavior when manipulating vectors using raw pointers.  The `bug.rs` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a safe alternative.  The key issue lies in modifying a vector's contents through a raw pointer after operations that might reallocate the vector's underlying data (e.g., pushing or popping elements). This can lead to data corruption or crashes.
